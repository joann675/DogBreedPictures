# DogBreedPictures

### Overview

Using the GIPHY API and the JQuery AJAX API, this site allows the user to load up to 10 images at a time of a specific dog breed. The initial pictures are static, non-animated gif images but will become animated when clicked on. Once animated, a subsequent click will reload the static image.
The logic to accomplish this was modeled after the class exercise to pause gifs. Besides the image, the rating is also displayed.
The user can load additional images by clicking on the Load more images button.  Each request will add up to 10 gifs to the page.
The user can also add a breed to the prepopulated list of breeds initially displayed.
